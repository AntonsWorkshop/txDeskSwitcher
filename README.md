**Use hotkeys to switch between Windows virtual desktops.**

This project is unapologetically done just for my particular use case, as fast as possible.  
It is hardcoded to use CTRL+WIN+[0~9] to switch between virtual desktops, and the GUID for the windows interfaces work specifically for my version of Windows 10 (22H2 19045.4291). If you want to use it for other versions, maybe check [@Grabacr07/VirtualDesktop](https://github.com/Grabacr07/VirtualDesktop) for the GUID of different builds.  
Also worth mentioning that I am not a C# developer, so the code is also unapologetically imperfect.
